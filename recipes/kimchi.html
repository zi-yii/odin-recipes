        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. 
                Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inch square. 
                Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves to coat. 
                Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most of the salt; 
                drain and squeeze out any excess liquid.</li>
            <li>Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting lid. 
                Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger. 
                Sprinkle Korean chile powder over mixture.; 
                wear plastic gloves to protect your hands and rub chile powder into cabbage leaves until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. 
                Leave undisturbed for 4 days. 
                Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!).</li>
